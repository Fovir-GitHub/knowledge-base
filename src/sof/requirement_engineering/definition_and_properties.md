## Definition

* Requirement engineering is the process of establishing
  1. the services that the customer requires from a system.
  2. the constraints under which it operates and is deployed.
* The IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology defines a requirement as: A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective.
* The requirements for a system are the descriptions of what the system should do the services and the constraints.

## Properties

* Requirements describe the necessary functions and features of the system, which includes
  * Performance
  * Schedule
  * Cost
  * Other Characteristics (e.g. lifecycle properties)
* Requirements are often organized hierarchically.
  * At a high level requirements focus on what should be achieved, not how to achieve it.
  * Requirements are specified at every level, from the overall system to each hardware and software component.
* Requirements may range from a high-level abstract statement of a service or of a system constraint to a detailed mathematical functional specification.
* Requirement is inevitable as it may serve a dual function.
* Requirements may be the basis for a bid for a contract, therefore must be open to interpretation.
* Requirements may be the basis for the contract itself, therefore must be defined in detail.
