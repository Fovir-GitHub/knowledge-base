* The system's operational domain imposes requirements on the system.
* Domain requirements can be new functional requirements, constraints on existing requirements, or define specific computations.
* If domain requirements are not satisfied, the system may be unworkable.

## Domain Requirements Problems

* **Understandability**
  * Requirements are expressed in the language of the application domain, which is often not understood by software engineers developing the system.
* **Implicitness**
  * Domain specialists understand the area so well that they do not think of making the domain requirements explicit, which leads software developers to implement the requirements in the wrong way.
