description: Introduce the software requirement specification (SRS).

## Definition

* The process of writing down the user and system requirements in a requirements document.
* User requirements have to be understandable by end users and customers who do not have a technical background.
* System requirements are more detailed requirements and may include more technical information.
* The requirements may be part of a contract for the system development.
* It is therefore important that these are as complete as possible.

## Need for SRS

* Help user understand his needs.
* SRS provides a reference for validation of the final product.
* High quality SRS essential for high Quality SW.
* Good SRS reduces the development cost.

## Structure of SRS

* Preface (including change history)
* Introduction
* Contents
* Glossary
* User requirements definition
* System architecture
* System requirements specification
* System models
* System evolution
* Appendices
* Index

## Key Characteristics of a Good SRS

* Some key ones are complete
* Unambiguous
* Consistent
* Verifiable
* Ranked for important and/or stability

## Requirements Document / Specification (SRS)

* The official statement of what is required of the system developers.
* Should include both a definition and a specification of requirement.
* It is not a design document.
* Set of what the system should do rather than how it should do it.
* **Specify external system behavior.** (What does it do?)
* **Specify implementation constraints.** (What system it must run on, what programming language it must use?)
* **Easy to change.** Serve as reference tool for maintenance.
* **Record forethought about the life cycle of the system.** (How can it be expanded for more users?)
* **Characterize response to unexpected events.** (e.g. What should it do if power is lost?)
* The level of detail depends on both the type of system and the development process being used.
* In evolutionary development model the requirements may change many times.
* In the waterfall model, it should be more complete before design stage.
* If the (sub-)system developed by an external contractor, or it is a critical system, more time needs to be taken on finalizing the requirements document.

### Way of Writing a System Requirements Specification

* Natural Language
  * mostly used, with some structure for the document Formal languages are precise and unambiguous, but hard Formal languages used for special features or in highly critical systems.
  * Lack of clarity.
  * Functional and non-functional requirements tend to be mixed-up in same document.
  * Several requirements may be expressed together, leading to problems with testing/debugging.
* Structured Natural Language
  * The requirement writer is limited and requirements are written in a standard way.
  * This works well for some types of requirements.
  * Form-based specifications:
    * Definition of the function or entity.
    * Description of inputs and where they come from.
    * Description of outputs and where they go to.
    * Information about the information needed for the computation and other entities used.
    * Description of the action to be taken.
    * Pre- and post-conditions (if appropriate).
    * The side effects (if any) of the function.
* Design Description Languages
* Graphical Notations
* Mathematical Specifications

## Use Case

* A description of the interactions possible between actors and system, that when executed, provide added value.
* Use case diagrams provide an overview.
* Use case descriptions provide the details.
