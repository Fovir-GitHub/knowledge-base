## Rapid Software Development

* Rapid development and delivery is now often the most important requirement for software systems
  * **Business operate in a fast:** changing requirements, and it is practically impossible to produce a set of stable software requirements.
  * Software has to evolve quickly to reflect changing business needs.
* Plan-driven development is essential for some types of system but does not meet these business needs.
* Agile development methods emerged in the last 1990s, whose aim was to radically reduce the delivery time for working software systems.

## Features of Agile Development

* Program specification, design and implementation are inter-leaved.
* The system is developed as a series of versions or increments with stakeholders involved in version specification and evaluation.
* Frequent delivery of new versions for evaluation.
* Extensive tool support used to support development.
* Minimal documentation: focus on working code.
