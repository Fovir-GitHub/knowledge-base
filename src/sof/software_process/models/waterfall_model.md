## The Waterfall Model

* It is an example of plan-driven process.

```

### Phases

* Requirements Analysis and Definition
  * Establish services, constraints, and goals by consultation with system users.
  * Defined in detail.
  * Serve as a system specification.
* System and Software Design
  * Allocate the requirements to either hardware or software system by establishing an overall system architecture.
  * Identifying and describing the fundamental software system abstractions and their relationships.
* Implementation and Unit Testing
  * Software design is realized as a set of programs of program units.
  * Unit testing involves verifying that each unit meets its specification.
* Integration and System Testing
  * The individual program units or programs are integrated and tested as a complete system.
  * After testing, the software system is delivered to the customer.
* Operation and Maintenance
  * The system is installed and put into practical use.
  * Maintenance involves correcting errors which were not discovered in earlier stages.

### Problems

* It is difficult to make any change during the development process. In principle, a phase has to be done before moving onto the next phase.
* Inflexible partitioning of the project into distinct stages makes it difficult to respond to changing customer requirements.
* The waterfall model is mostly used for large system engineering projects, where a system is developed at several sites.
