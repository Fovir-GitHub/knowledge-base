The system release is for customers and users normally. 

Release testing is the process of testing a particular release of a system that is intended for use outside the development team.

## Goals of Release Testing

* Check the system meets its requirements and is good enough for external use.
* The primary goal is to convince the supplier of the system that is good enough for use.

## Scenario Testing

Devise typical scenarios of use and use these to develop test cases for the system.

A scenario describes one way in which the system might be used.

Scenarios should be realistic and real system users should be able to relate to them.
