## Definition

"Memo" is the abbreviation of "memorandum".

It is a short document used to transit information inside an organization.

Memos are less formal than letters.

The purpose of a memo is normally to provide or request factual information.

## Requirements

A memo should be brief, direct and easy to navigate.

To achieve the brief requirement, the number of paragraph should be 2-4, and generally 2-3.

The body part should follow the `PDA` principle.

## Tips

A memo should include only one topic, and state the purpose clearly.

Avoid using memo to deliver bad news.
