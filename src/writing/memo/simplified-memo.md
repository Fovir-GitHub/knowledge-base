Generally, a simplified memo can be divided into three parts - heading, body, and footer.

## Elements

### Heading

Compared to traditional memos, simplified memos do not need to write "FROM", "TO", etc. in the heading part. But these elements are required as well and the format is:

> Date
>
> Audience
>
> Subject

### Body

This part is the same as traditional memos, which explains and shares the main idea of the memo.

### Footer

This part is similar with the footer of a business letter. The format is:

* Signature
* Name, Position

## Example

A simplified memo from the general manager to all staff about invitation of annual dinner can be written as:

> 19 July 2025
>
> All Staff
>
> Invitation of Annual Dinner
>
> Purpose
>
> Detail
>
> Action
>
> Alice (Signature)
>
> Alice, General Manager
